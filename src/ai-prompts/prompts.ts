    Based on the user description, generate a JSON object matching the Zod schema.

    - symptoms: Extract at least one symptom. If the symptoms are not similar, don't group them, create separate entries instead.
    - description: Summarize, clean up, and fix any mistakes before adding it to the JSON.
    - If data is missing, leave fields empty. Ignore missing details.
    - Be aware that today's date is ${new Date()}
